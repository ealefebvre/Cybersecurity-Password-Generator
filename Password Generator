Password Generator
By: Ellie LeFebvre

This code generates passwords using different characters and lengths in a randomized fashion. This is helpful for cybersecurity in the sense
that it will always generate something new and it gives the user the ability to easily get a generated password of various lengths in order
to use them on different applications so they are all different.

    #this part shuffles the list to prevent predictable patterns and convert it to a string
    random.shuffle(password_chars) #takes all of the random choices and shuffles them around

print("Generated secure password:", password) #this will then print the password that is generated
